=head1 Enhance Your Development Workflow with the e Module:

You know how certain aspects of development can be
a real drag - slow and pretty boring?
I’ve definitely been there. But here’s where the C<e>
module comes in and changes the game.

=head1 Rapid Prototyping:

The C<e> module comes loaded in with many features
that can aid in rapid prototyping as well as testing.

=head2 Let's Make Selenium Testing Less Painful Again:

One of its cool features is the C<repl> breakpoint
command, which can seriously simplify debugging and
testing processes across the board.

It can also be used from the command line like this:

=begin perl

    perl -Me -e 'my $var = 111; repl'

=end perl

With that simple one-liner, you trigger an
interactive breakpoint which pauses the execution
of the program and allows you to investigate data
and try things out. Once satisfied, you can quit
the debugger and code flow would continue as usual.

So, instead of dealing with all the usual hassle
of setting "breakpoints" and debugging manually
(yes, I taking about you C<print>), you can use
C<e> to just pop in a breakpoint whenever you
need it. This means you can pause execution,
check out what’s going on, and make adjustments
on the fly.

A prime example of where C<e> shines is in
Selenium testing, where it can significantly
ease the process. Selenium tests can be
notoriously slow and cumbersome, but the
C<repl> breakpoint feature makes it less painful.

However, it’s not just for Selenium, C<e> can
enhance various development tasks by making the
whole debugging and testing experience accelerated,
quickly done, and, dare I say, even a bit enjoyable.

=head2 Performance Efficiency:

Worried about performance? Well, stop it!
C<e> has been optimized to have a very tiny
footprint to conserve space and resources.
Also, it makes great use of Just In Time (JIT)
module loading: you pay only for what you use.
For instance, I use it on my smartphone with Termux,
and it’s incredibly fast - even with the phone's
limited resources. The impact is practically
negligible, and it runs smoothly without any
noticeable delays.

=head2 User Testimonials:

TODO - MAYBE

=head2 Interactive Demos:

To see C<e> in action, just install it with cpan(m):

=begin code

    cpanm e

=end code

Then skim through the short doc.

You can also try out this L<Perl Banjo|https://perlbanjo.com/dbce20686b>
interactive demo. You can run a few example
snippets and experiment with them directly.

Feel free to modify the snippets on the right to explore
different features and see how C<e> can enhance
your own development workflow.

(Unfortunately, at this time, not all features can be currently
used in PerlBanjo.)
