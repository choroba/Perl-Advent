=head2 Have fun with Map::Tube

L<Map::Tube> was one of my earliest submissions to C<CPAN> and it's a project that's very close to my heart. Over the years, I've had the joy of writing about it and I've spoken about it at many conferences. I consider it my baby though I share it with many amazing contributors who have helped make it sleeker and more powerful. Each day, I'm thankful for the contributions of those who've made this project better. Many thanks also to everyone who has used used the library to build maps for cities around the world. As of today, there are L<41 maps|https://metacpan.org/pod/Map::Tube#MAP-LEADER-BOARD> created by C<11 contributors>.

=head2 Inspiration behind the map

Our first window to open is about inspiration! The journey began with the idea to create a map for the C<London Tube>, the famous underground rail network. The first map created was L<Map::Tube::London>. As work on C<Map::Tube::London> progressed, I realized there was an opportunity to build a framework so others could create map for their own cities. And so, C<Map::Tube> was born. So now you know where the term C<Tube> came from!

=head2 The first day's play: Let's get started

It's time to open the first window and dive in! To get started, you'll need to install the framework and at least one map. For today, let's stick with the C<London Tube>.

=begin code

    $ cpanm -v Map::Tube

    $ cpanm -v Map::Tube::London

=end code

Now it's time to get your hands dirty!

=begin perl

    use v5.40;
    use Map::Tube::London;

    my $map = Map::Tube::London->new;
    say $map->get_shortest_route('Baker Street', 'Wembley Park');

=end perl

Opening the window to the route finder, you should see something like this:

=begin code

    Baker Street (Bakerloo, Circle, Hammersmith & City, Jubilee, Metropolitan), Finchley Road (Jubilee, Metropolitan), Wembley Park (Jubilee, Metropolitan)

=end code

Nice and easy, right?

If you're feeling a bit lazy and don't want to write the C<4 lines> perl, no worries, there's a shortcut! The L<Map::Tube::CLI> distribution comes with a command line utility called C<map-tube>.

Let's repeat today's fun with just one line using the command line tool: C<map-tube>.

=begin code

    $ cpanm -v Map::Tube::CLI

    $ map-tube --map London --start 'Baker Street' --end 'Wembley Park'
    Baker Street (Bakerloo, Circle, Hammersmith & City, Jubilee, Metropolitan), Finchley Road (Jubilee, Metropolitan), Wembley Park (Jubilee, Metropolitan)

=end code

=head2 So what's inside the map? Peek behind the curtain

Curious about how it all works? Open the next window to peek inside! There's a package called L<Map::Tube::Cookbook>, which is part of the C<Map::Tube> distribution that explains everything that you need to know to create a new map.

I remember the first time I gave a presentation about C<Map::Tube> at C<London Perl Workshop 2017>. During the talk, I challenged the audience to create a map by the end of the workshop and win a prize. To my delight, we had <Map::Tube::Athens> by C<Errietta Kostala>.

=head2 Can I create a map image? Yes you can!

Openning the next window, you'll find the answer: Yes, you can generate a map images in C<png> format. Use the C<map-tube> command line tool to make it happen:

=begin code

    $ map-tube --map London --generate_map

=end code

Or if you only want a particular line, like the C<Bakerloo Line>, here's how you do it.

=begin code

    $ map-tube --map London --line Bakerloo --generate_map

=end code

=head2 Build your own map server

Openning the next window reveals the magic behind creating a map server. With the help of L<Map::Tube::Server|https://metacpan.org/pod/Map::Tube::Server>, setting up a map server is easy. Here's how to create your server with C<map-server.psgi>:

=begin code

    use v5.40;
    use Map::Tube::Server;
    use Plack::Builder;

    builder { mount '/map-tube/v1' => Map::Tube::Server->to_app; };

=end code

Once you've set it up, start your map server like this:

=begin code

    $ plackup map-server.psgi
    HTTP::Server::PSGI: Accepting connections at http://0:5000/

=end code

Let's make a call to the map server to repeat today's search i.e. finding the route from C<Baker Street> to C<Wembley Park>.

=begin code

    $ curl http://127.0.0.1:5000/map-tube/v1/shortest-route/london/baker%20street/wembley%20park
    ["Baker Street (Bakerloo, Circle, Hammersmith and City, Jubilee, Metropolitan)","Finchley Road (Jubilee, Metropolitan)","Wembley Park (Jubilee, Metropolitan)"]

=end code

=head2 Access the public API

Behind the next window, you'll find the public API! If you've have setup your map server, you can access the service through an API, using the distribution: L<Map::Tube::API|https://metacpan.org/dist/Map-Tube-API>. First set the C<MAP_BASE_URL> environment variable.

=begin code

    $ export MAP_BASE_URL=http://127.0.0.1:5000

=end code

Now let's create a script, C<map-api.pl>, to make the API call:

=begin code

    use v5.40;
    use Data::Dumper;
    use Map::Tube::API;

    say Dumper($api->shortest_route({ map => 'london', start => 'Baker Street', end => 'Wembley Park' }));

=end code

It's time to make that API call:

=begin code

    $ perl map-api.pl
    $VAR1 = [
          'Baker Street (Bakerloo, Circle, Hammersmith and City, Jubilee, Metropolitan)',
          'Finchley Road (Jubilee, Metropolitan)',
          'Wembley Park (Jubilee, Metropolitan)'
    ];

=end code

=head2 How about other maps? Open a new city!

Ready for a new adventure? Open the next window to discover how to install other city maps. To install a map, like C<Delhi>, just do the following:

=begin code

    $ cpanm -v Map::Tube::Delhi

=end code

Or, if you're feeling adventurous and want to explore all the maps, use the distribution L<Task::Map::Tube::Metro|https://metacpan.org/pod/Task::Map::Tube::Metro> to install them all at once.

=begin code

    $ cpanm -v Task::Map::Tube::Metro

=end code
