Title: Half My Life with Perl
Topic: Randal Schwartz

I had never met Randal Schwartz before, but when I reached out to him about
contributing to year 25 of the Perl Advent Calendar, he immediately agreed.
This year I wanted to try some new things and Randal suggested giving a
Perl-specific talk which he had given once before, but which was lacking in
recording quality. This gave Randal a chance to re-record his talk and it gave
the Perl communities a chance to watch in real time. We've never before had
a video recording as a Perl Advent article, but I believe quite strongly that
this is in the spirit of the Advent Calendar project, which is about giving
something back. Also, when I mentioned it to Mark Fowler back in October, he
didn't object, so I'll take that as a seal of approval.

Randal's advance summary of this talk:

    Having been there, at the beginning with Perl, I will recount the early
    days through the modern era (or as much as I can cover in the time
    provided). I’ll deliver first-hand experience of the creation of the Camel
    Book, the Llama book, and the way I invaded comp.unix.questions with Perl 2
    answers so often that people would post “no Perl please”. Oh, and my
    version of the story of the Schwartzian Transform.
