Thank you for your contribution! I'm finding that blog articles which include
images have much more compelling social media previews when the article is
shared. Adding an image is by no means required and you should feel free to
ignore this message entirely. However, if you'd like to add an image, it's as
simple as:

* Adding the image to the `2024/share/static` folder like `2024/share/static/some-graphic.png`
* Including the image as HTML in your article

The HTML would look like:

```pod
=for :html
<img src="some-graphic.png">

```

The trailing blank line is important as that signals that the `HTML` section is finished.

Images can most certainly be AI generated. You should also feel free to use
https://search.creativecommons.org/ in order to find CC images which can be
freely shared. If you choose to go this route, please provide proper
attribution when including the image, if attribution is required.

Most importantly, if you don't feel like doing this, then feel free to submit
your article without an image. It's *your* article and *you* need to be happy
with it.
